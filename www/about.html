<h2>About the Creators: </h2>

<p>

Shrivatsa Kulkarni is a highschool senior with ambitions to head into the medical field as a Neurosurgeon and someday establish his own practice.
 He explores the nooks and crannies of science by taking all AP science courses available to him. In his free time, he participates in community service, aiming to better the lives of others.
 For recreation, he works out at the gym and plays basketball with his friends and produces music using a digital audio workstation. 
Shrivatsa is passionate about neuroscience and decided this app was a great way to apply his passion towards helping people.
<br><br>
Kiran Chandrasekhar is a highschool senior with a passion for computer science and all things programming. He seeks to learn all he can in terms of programming, 
and has thus dipped his feet into many fields, such as algorithms, website, or application development, and has also pursued interests such as music theory outside
of code. It is his hope to provide the greatest good he can to the world within his own niche and areas of expertise, and thusly he decided that this app would be a 
great oppurtunity to both hone his skills and provide a much-needed service
